# ppt_builder

PyQt, pillow (PIL), python-pptx

This powerpoint builder was developed to fill a need in the Market Research department; too put it simply, this program saves the user hours of time by building a 300+ slide power point in minutes.

This is intended for use by the Market Research department to build slides of handwriting samples (in a format specific to the department). The presentation is sorted by name candidate and each name candidate section is sorted by country (in an order also specified by the department)

The main interface, fairly simple and easy to understand
